# Introduction

Basic Principles of Git


## What does Git Offer?

* Git is a place to store content <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Mostly code
  * Documents and presentations ([Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown))
  * Avoid large, binary blobs (if you have, check out [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/))
* Git gives you version control <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * History of code changes
  * Manage different versions of your code (*branches*)
* Git support collaboration in a distributed team <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Store a copy of your code on remote servers
  * Everybody has a copy of the entire repository
  * Let multiple people contribute changes easily


## GUI or CLI?

* Command Line Interface (CLI) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Get it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)
  * Efficient if you know what you are doing
  * Hard, if you are not used to CLIs
  * Automate things, easy to share and repeat
* Integrated Development Environments (IDE) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * Simplified Git clients in IDEs
  * Useful for typical, day-to-day use cases
* Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * *You still need to understand Git fundamentals!*
  * So many options, e.g. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/), [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


## GUI or CLI?

> In this course, we will focus on the CLI.

* Reason: Easier to share and repeat
  * Use a GUI in everyday work if you prefer


## Git Server Products

* Remote repository for distributed version control <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Combine Git version control with related topics like... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * ...project and task management,
  * ...code reviews and discussions about changes,
  * ...continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD),
  * ...code security scanning,
  * ...package management, etc.
* Examples: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  * GitHub, Azure DevOps, AWS CodeCommit, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.


## Git Server Products

> In this course, we will focus on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

* Reasons: Free, very widely used
  * Make sure you have a GitHub account
  * If you don't have one already, [please join](https://github.com/join) now
  * Note: You can [keep your email address private](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address) if you want
